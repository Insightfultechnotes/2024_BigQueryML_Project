# This Project is to demonstrate the working of BigQuery ML and Looker Studio

I have used an open dataset like the Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle).

What You Want To Achieve
âœ… Ingest or prepare your customer data
âœ… Predict churn risk (could call BigQuery ML model inside)
âœ… Store cleaned + enriched data back into BigQuery
âœ… Visualize it later in Looker

Step                    Tool Used        	Purpose
Data Load               BigQuery        	Store customer data
Model Training	        BigQuery            ML	Build logistic regression churn model
Prediction	            BigQuery            ML	Predict churn probability
Storage	                BigQuery	        Save prediction results
Visualization	        Looker Studio	    Build interactive churn dashboard
Automation (Optional)	Scheduled Query	    Refresh predictions periodically
