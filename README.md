# This Project is to demonstrate the working of BigQuery ML and Looker Studio

I have used an open dataset like the Telco Customer Churn dataset (Kaggle).
    https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn

What You Want To Achieve
âœ… Ingest or prepare your customer data
âœ… Predict churn risk (could call BigQuery ML model inside)
âœ… Store cleaned + enriched data back into BigQuery
âœ… Visualize it later in Looker
